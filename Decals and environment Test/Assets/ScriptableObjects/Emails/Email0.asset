  body: "To be entirely fair, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m about to walk into.
    When I asked them, Howard and Lucy seemed very nervous as well. <br> If the very
    people who are in charge of this seem to lack confidence, I cannot really see
    how I should be feeling any differently. <br> That said, there is only one path
    ahead of me, and I must walk it. <br><br> If mom was here, she\u2019d know what
    to tell me. I won\u2019t let that thing take another person away from me. "
