  body: "Over the length of my career, I saw many cases like her. Even at this point,
    there is no way to know for certain what kind of impact the therapy will bring.
    <br> Lying would be pointless: for illnesses like hers, it\u2019s more realistic
    to hope for a slow deterioration, rather than improvement. I am aware of how
    this feels like, however, that is not to bring you down. <br><br>  Even though
    I don\u2019t know much, when you told me of the experiment, and what you are
    going to go through, I felt touched by your resolve. <br> I wish you \u2013 and
    most importantly her \u2013 all the best. Don\u2019t forget to let me know how
    that goes. <br><br> I\u2019ll see both of you for our usual Tuesday appointment,
    same time. We\u2019ll keep trying to surface the memory of your encounter in
    the garden, that seemed to be working well. "
