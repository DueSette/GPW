  title: Keep your focus on
  sender: Howard Bailey
  receivers: Lucy Brown
  body: "Look Lucy, I get all of it. The ethics of it, the personal investment, the
    sense of responsibility. I get it, I do. But we agreed on it, we held a meeting,
    you signed, I signed, the guys from downstairs signed. We put our names on it,
    and we are going to go through with this experiment. <br> <br> It\u2019s your
    own work after all, have some confidence in it. After all, it\u2019s exactly
    that confidence that got you to the position you\u2019re at now. <br><br> Yeah,
    the implant can be dangerous, this is our first trial, it\u2019s a little bit
    early, all that stuff. I get it, but we can\u2019t back out of this now: the
    subject is getting the implant embedded in his spine as we speak. Take a deep
    breath, clean your desk, and meet us at the spot. Our careers depend on this. "
