  body: "Hello Jesse! I hope you're doing well! To answer your question, yes, we're
    going to need a code to access the conference room starting tomorrow. As I'm
    sure you're aware of we must not take chances these days, so the conference room
    will be protected via code. Super boring, I know, but better than having to deal
    with Howard blabbing about security all the time. . <br><br> The code is: XXXX.
    <br><br> For your other question, it's a point of order for tomorrow's meeting,
    but I can already tell you a subject finally stepped in. See you tomorrow!  Regards,
    \u201CSpec\u201D "
