  title: Fed up with this
  sender: Jeremy M. Meek
  receivers: Lucy Brown
  body: "So, let me get this straight: we make the poor bastard wake up upstairs,
    all riddled with amnesia, that hellish thing in his spine, and the office, HIS
    OFFICE, all changed so he has no way of catching a goddamn clue, just to figure
    out if the implant EVEN WORKS? <br><br> This is the last straw, I can understand
    some sketchy corporate moves, but this is our own personnel, and most specifically,
    my friend we are talking about. <br> I might not be on the tech team, but even
    I know that the implant could go from making you see things to melting your brain,
    and apparently, I care about it way more than all of you combined. <br><br> As
    I\u2019m writing this, there are people in the other room changing furniture,
    locking stuff on purpose, cutting the fuses, and even dragging some fancy ass
    metal plaque out of God knows where, all for the sake of this so called \u201Cexperiment\u201D?
    <br><br> Do what you will, I am completely fed up with this madness. I\u2019m
    telling people. I\u2019m letting the world know. Sue me, or maybe mess with my
    brain too, since you decided that playing with people\u2019s lives is fine. <br>
    If you have some sense of self worth, Lucy, you\u2019ll do the same. If anything
    bad happens tonight, that will be on you. "
